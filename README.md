BUILD: OXFORD (225)
VERSION: 2017.0.1a

## Changelog
**NOTE**: *The changelog is relative to leafpad 2. Any features mentioned are added, changed or removed from the original leafpad version*

**General**
- Added accelerators for copy, paste, cut, redo, undo and open =!
- Removed the help menu from the menubar ==!
- Removed the debug tab from the menubar
- Added save function so there is no prompt when saving ===!
- Added support for Linux and Mac OS -? ====!
- Added a dynamic title which changes depending on the file that is open.

**Known Problems**
*Note: There are lots of problems due to me uploading the program to edit at school. I wil release a quick patch later to solve some of these issues.

=! - Accelerators for some menus have not been adding in yet (current known: filemenu open and save; mousemenu delete; editmenu redo undo)
==! - Help menu bar will still be there but is redundant
===! - This is a current problem that I have no idea how to fix. (Help would greatly be appreciated)

**Resolved Problems**

-? - Removing the string on the line 11 (root = Tk([HERE])) allows better linux support and should work now. (It used to say "Text Editor" but now it has been removed.

### Other software
Tkinter, written by Fredrik Lundh has no association with Ida By Fresco and allows Fresco to use their code under their lisence (everybody has right to this code as it is open source)
